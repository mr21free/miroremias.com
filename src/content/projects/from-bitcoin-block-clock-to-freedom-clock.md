title: From Block Clock to Freedom Clock - The Metric That Finally Clicked
description: "I built a Bitcoin block clock because protocol time fascinated me. Then I rebuilt it into something that made more sense to my actual life: a Freedom Clock that turns savings into time, shows how much of my remaining life is covered, and reminds me not to waste the time I still have."

## The moment the block clock stopped clicking for me

I loved the idea of a block clock long before I built one.

It has a certain Bitcoiner elegance to it. No apps. No exchange tabs. No endless refreshing. Just protocol time, quietly moving forward in the background.

So I did what builders usually do. I looked at what was already out there, compared options, and tried to picture which one I would actually want on my desk every day.

And honestly, I bounced off most of them.

Some looked beautiful but felt more like expensive decor than something I wanted to live with. Some were closed. Some were too large. And a few were priced high enough that I caught myself thinking: *hang on, am I really about to pay this much for a tiny screen and a vibe?*

So I did the predictable thing: **I built my own.**

How hard can it be, right?

I already had a Bitcoin node, and I was already generating Bitcoin-related signals on my local network. Publishing a few network stats and consuming them on a little display shouldn’t be a big deal.

Then I found exactly what I needed: a small e-ink board with Wi-Fi and the option to run on a battery.

The goal was simple: a calm, always-on Bitcoin clock I could put anywhere without constantly thinking about the battery.

That’s how the first version started.

I built it because I genuinely love the idea of **protocol time**.

Bitcoin clicks forward like a charm: block by block, roughly every ~10 minutes, indifferent to narratives.

A block clock makes that tangible.

You glance at it. No apps. No exchanges. No drama. Just: *the network is alive, and it keeps moving.*

And then, after the novelty wore off, I ran into an annoying truth:

**My brain doesn’t live in blocks. It lives in time on this earth.**

When the screen said:

- “114,419 blocks to halving”

My brain didn’t feel grounded. It didn’t feel motivated. It felt… nothing.

It immediately translated it into:

> “Cool. So… a few years.”

That number is correct. It just does not feel *human*.

## Bitcoin time vs human time

Bitcoin time is objective.

- block height
- issuance schedule
- difficulty adjustment
- halving cycles

Human time is more emotional.

- mornings and evenings
- birthdays and school years
- projects and seasons
- the feeling of wasting your best hours in a job you don’t enjoy

So I flipped the question.

Instead of asking:

**“What can Bitcoin tell me about the network?”**

I started asking:

**“What is Bitcoin buying me in human terms?”**

And the answer wasn’t “blocks.”

The answer was **time**.

Time I don’t need to sell.  
Time I can spend with my kids.  
Time I can spend building things I actually care about.  
Time I can stop trading my life for a schedule I didn’t choose.

That was the moment the block clock transformed into something else.

## The Freedom Clock (v2)

So I started building a second version.

Not a block clock.

A **Freedom Clock**.

Same physical idea (calm, always-on, no distractions).  
Same builder spirit (open, hackable, yours).  
But a different purpose:

> **Not “Bitcoin ticks.”**  
> **“How much freedom have I bought?”**

![Freedom Clock - Main Screen](/images/posts/blog8_freedom_clock_screen_1-sq.jpeg)
> The main screen: expected freedom time, expected lifetime left, and freedom coverage.

![Freedom Clock - Details Screen](/images/posts/blog8_freedom_clock_screen_2-sq.jpeg)
> The second screen: the assumptions behind the number.


### What it shows now

The new version is built around **three connected signals**:

1. **Expected freedom time:** how long the portfolio could support the chosen lifestyle.
2. **Expected lifetime left:** a quiet reminder that time itself is limited.
3. **Freedom coverage:** what percentage of the remaining expected lifetime is covered by the portfolio.

Not in blocks. Not only in fiat. In human units:

- years
- months
- weeks

This is basically the question behind FIRE, stripped down to the core:

> “If I stopped earning tomorrow, how long could I keep living the life I want?”

But the second number changed the product for me.

The device is no longer only about money. It is also a small memento mori on my desk. It reminds me that even if the portfolio keeps growing, the other clock keeps moving too. The goal is not to stare at the number and feel clever. The goal is to ask whether I am using my time well.

The freedom number depends on assumptions: monthly expenses, inflation, portfolio growth, BTC price, life expectancy, and the withdrawal model. That is why the device now has a second screen. The first screen is emotional. The second screen is trust.

It turns Bitcoin from an abstract asset into a **compass**.

### Why this is more motivational than network stats

Network stats are true. They’re important. They’re also… emotionally neutral for most people.

Freedom time is different.

It makes you ask:

- “Do I want to trade my next year for this job?”
- “Is this project worth my time?”
- “What would I do if I had 6 months more freedom?”
- “Am I building the life I want *or just surviving until Friday*?”
- “If I really have this much time left, what am I postponing for no good reason?”

That is why this device finally clicked for me.

I also showed the newer version to my wife, who is not a Bitcoiner. That became a useful test. She understood the core idea immediately: savings converted into time, and life expectancy shown as a second clock. The one label that confused her was “lifetime covered.” She read it as “how much of my life I have already lived,” not “how much of my remaining life is covered by savings.”

That was a good reminder: if the metric needs explaining, the label is wrong. So I changed the wording toward **freedom coverage**.

---

## What stayed the same (builder principles)

A Freedom Clock is still a Bitcoin-native project in the ways that matter:

- **calm by design** (no constant refresh, no alerts)
- **local-first mindset** (avoid leaking personal data to third parties where possible)
- **simple beats flashy** (function first, polish later)
- **you control the signal** (you decide what matters)

In other words: it’s still not a consumer gadget. It’s a **habit**.

A reminder on your desk that your attention is valuable. That your time is finite. That you’re building toward something.

The main screen is intentionally simple. It should be readable in one glance. The details screen exists so the main screen can stay calm without hiding the assumptions.

---

## What I learned along the way

### 1) The hardest part isn’t the hardware

It’s choosing a metric that changes your behavior.

A dashboard can be technically perfect and still be useless.

If the screen went dark tomorrow, what would you actually miss?

That question is brutal. And helpful.

### 2) “Real-time” is usually a trap

Frequent updates drain battery and steal attention.

For a calm desk device, slow cadence wins.

### 3) Assumptions matter more than precision

The first versions were more about getting the metric onto the screen.

The newer version made something obvious: if the number is emotional, the assumptions need to be visible. Otherwise it feels like magic.

So the second screen shows the inputs: BTC amount, BTC price, portfolio growth, inflation, monthly expenses, birth year, life expectancy, and withdrawal mode.

That is not there to make the device feel complicated. It is there to make the main screen believable.

### 4) Price still has a role (but it’s not the point)

I still include price, not as a signal to act, but as a translator people naturally use today.

The Freedom Clock shifts the focus: price becomes secondary to freedom time and choice.

---

## Next steps: where this goes from here

The current version has two screens:

- a main screen for expected freedom time, expected lifetime left, and freedom coverage
- a details screen for the assumptions behind the calculation

That already feels much closer to the product I wanted.

The next step is probably not more data. It is better rhythm.

I want this device to become something you check weekly, not something that pulls you into price anxiety. A useful future view could show how much freedom changed since the last check-in:

- freedom gained or lost since last week
- time left reduced by another week
- whether the gap is closing or widening

That would make the device less like a dashboard and more like a ritual.

And I will probably keep iterating on the name too. Right now, **Freedom Clock** is the best fit because it says the quiet part out loud:

Bitcoin isn’t just a network. It’s a tool for *reclaiming your time*.

### Freedom has more than one meaning

"Freedom" is not just one thing. People chase different versions of it:

- **Time freedom:** you control your schedule and how you spend your days.
- **Location freedom:** you can live/work from where you prefer (digital nomads are the classic example).
- **Financial freedom:** you can cover your life and spend on what matters without constant money stress.
- **Any combination:** most people want a mix of these, not just one.

### A deeper kind of freedom: the courage to be disliked

In *The Courage to Be Disliked*, freedom is framed differently: it starts when you allow yourself to be disliked. Not because you want conflict, but because living honestly means you won’t satisfy everyone’s expectations.

The moment you stop optimizing for approval and start listening to what you truly want from life, you become harder to control, and you begin to feel genuinely free.

## What you can do

### Beginner

- Don’t start with “all the metrics.”
- Start with **one question you want to answer every day**.
- Build a calm display for that question (hardware or software).
- Keep it visible for 30 days.

### Advanced

- Treat privacy as a feature.
- Avoid turning personal data into something visible to strangers, guests, or cameras.
- Prefer ranges or progress indicators over exact numbers.
